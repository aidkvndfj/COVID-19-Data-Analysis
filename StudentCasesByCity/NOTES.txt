The original question of "
How does the rate of infections for students in a specific school board change over time, compared to the rate of students (0 - 13, 14 - 17) that tested positive province-wide over time?
"
has now been changed to "
How does the total number of student cases since school has gone online, compare across different cities in Ontario?
"

If the user enters 'Toronto' as one of the cities, it is the ONLY outlier
across the 100 or so cities, totaling an extremely high number of around 13000.

March 25th, 2021 Update:
    The extractConfirmedStudentCases.py script was forgetting to add the
    actual number of student cases reported by the schools, and is now
    accurately representing the total number of positive cases of students
    in their respective cities.

    Also, the extractConfirmedStudentCases.py script was refactored using
    a dictionary instead of a list to be more descriptive.
